## CommonOptions.include property

Include files to make available in the remote function. See [IncludeOption](./faastjs.includeoption.md)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
include?: (string | IncludeOption)[];
```

## Remarks

Each include entry is a directory or glob pattern. Paths can be specified as relative or absolute paths. Relative paths are resolved relative to the current working directory, or relative to the `cwd` option.

If the include entry is a directory `"foo/bar"`<!-- -->, the directory `"./foo/bar"` will be available in the cloud function. Directories are recursively added.

Glob patterns use the syntax of [node glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob)<!-- -->.

Also see [CommonOptions.exclude](./faastjs.commonoptions.exclude.md) for file exclusions.
