## CommonOptions.maxRetries property

Maximum number of times that faast will retry each invocation. Default: 2 (invocations can therefore be attemped 3 times in total).

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
maxRetries?: number;
```

## Remarks

Retries are automatically attempted for transient infrastructure-level failures such as rate limits or netowrk failures. User-level exceptions are not retried automatically. In addition to retries performed by faast, some providers automatically attempt retries. These are not controllable by faast. But as a result, your function may be retried many more times than this setting suggests.
